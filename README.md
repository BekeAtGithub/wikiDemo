Approach: Using GitHub to Manage Wikipedia Content

Since Wikipedia requires manual editing, you can still automate parts of your workflow using Python scripts and Wikipediaâ€™s API.
Steps to Integrate GitHub with Wikipedia:

    Store Wikipedia Page Content in a GitHub Repository
        Create a README.md or another text-based file (.txt, .md, or .html) in your GitHub repository containing the content of your Wikipedia article.

    Use a Python Script with Wikipedia API (Pywikibot) for Updates
        Wikipedia supports updates via Pywikibot, a Python-based automation tool that allows you to edit Wikipedia programmatically.

    Automate Edits Using GitHub Actions
        Use GitHub Actions to trigger an update when changes are pushed to the repository.

        Create a Wikipedia Bot Account

    Register a bot account on Wikipedia: Bot Registration / https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Creating_a_bot
    Request API access.

    Will have to run python pwb.py generate_user_files to activate user-config.py file

How It Works

    GitHub Repository: Store the Wikipedia article's content in a file (yourfile.md).
    Python Script: Fetch the content from GitHub and push it to Wikipedia using Pywikibot.
    GitHub Actions: Automate updates by running the Python script whenever new changes are pushed to the repository.
